We are discussing inside the chips.

This board can be represented as a block diagram.

An Arduino board drives all the pins.

Chip to I/O pad connections shall be made as shown in the diagram.

PADS allows one to communicate with the external world

The core is where actual digital logic sits.

RISC-V Design, as shown in the figure

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f624d52-e60a-4334-b638-b3af40f5c5c9)

consists of the PLL, SRAM, CORE, DAC, ETC

Some are foundry IPs.

All performances of chips depend on foundry IP

The foundry is a big factory with machines where chips are manufactured. VLSI engineers continuously communicate with the foundry

The foundry usually provides some interface files to communicate with the foundry. 

  # RISC V ISA

ISA is the way we talk to the computer

C program is compiled and converted to assembly >>, and then to machine-level language.

The binary is in ones and zeros, which hardware can understand. 

Then, each bit will be executed on the hardware.

The RTL2GDS flow starts with the RISC V architecture and is then converted to Layout.

but the user will be just executing the 'c' program

HOW does Application software run on the Hardware?

OS handles IO operations and memory. 

then the compiler converts these to machine language 

the output of the application is small c/c++ functions --> then converted to instruction sets suitable for the process

#SOC Design using Openlane

To design, we need RTL IPs, EDA tools, PDK( Process design kit) data


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a848142e-4891-4467-9f7c-914e6b535b1f)

In open source - we have a lot of RTL sources.

We also many academics based EDA tools

What is PDK?

* In the "age of gods!" the design of IC was tightly integrated with manufacturing processes available with each company
* Lynn Conway and Carver Mead envisioned the need to separate the design from the technology

Since then, we have started seeing. 


But These PDK are covered under NDA, So Google worked on the opernsource PDK

Now, we have all the elements for the ASIC design.

The cutting edge is 5nm, but the 130nm is fast enough?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d8dbbc8-eeac-4a4a-8ac9-8ed61900cc99)

for all the performance advance nodes not required 

130nm is still valid for many applications

Pipelined of the above CPU can 1GHz

ASIC design is a complex process that requires a lot of complex steps.
