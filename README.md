We are discussing inside the chips

This board can be represented as a block diagram

An Arduino board drives all the pins.

Chip to I/O pad connections shall be made as shown in the diagram.

PADS allows one to communicate with the external world

The core is where actual digital logic sits.

consists of the PLL, SRAM, CORE, DAC, ETC

Some are foundry IPs.

All performances of chips depend on foundry IP

The foundry is a big factory with machines where chips are manufactured. VLSI engineers continuously communicate with the foundry

The foundry usually provides some interface files to communicate with the foundry.
